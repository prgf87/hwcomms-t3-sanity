        <h1>My Values</h1>
        <h2>Seek Extraordinary Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          You deserve my best, so you&apos;ll get it. Which means that I&apos;m
          always on the lookout for a chance to delight you and your team
          (that&apos;s the fun part of the job!).
        </p>
        <h2>Be Thorough</h2>
        <p>
          My grandfather always said, “If you don&apos;t do it right, you might
          as well not do it at all.” I believe in doing the job well down to the
          smallest detail.
        </p>
        <h2>Have Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          In my line of work, integrity presents itself in the form of radical
          candor. I will always tell you the truth (the good, the bad, the
          ugly).
        </p>
        <h2>Move Forward, Move Fast</h2>
        <p>
          In the literal interpretation of this value, excellent communications
          must be timely (no argument there), but “Moving Forward” also applies
          to doing my homework on learning the industry&apos;s best, newest
          ideas (and come up with a few on the way) so that your communications
          are fresh and relevant.
